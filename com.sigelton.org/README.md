Sigelton Design Pattern!
===================


Singleton pattern is one of the simplest design patterns in Java. This type of design pattern comes under creational pattern as this pattern provides one of the best ways to create an object.

This pattern involves a single class which is responsible to create an object while making sure that only single object gets created. This class provides a way to access its only object which can be accessed directly without need to instantiate the object of the class.

Thread-Safe and a Fast Singleton Implementation â€“ Singleton Design Pattern in java

Through this approach we provide the necessary thread-safety, NOT using Singleton instance is created at class-load time. We've used Simple Singleton Pattern: (Lazy Initialization + ThreadSafe with synchronized block)
